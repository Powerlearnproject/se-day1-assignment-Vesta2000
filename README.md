#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is all about writing instructions(codes), building apps & games and making our lives easier by solving real-world problems. It provides the back-bone for developing and deploying emergent tech trends such as AI models, machine learning and IoT.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
The "Software Crisis" and the Birth of Software Engineering (Late 1960s):  This crisis highlighted the lack of systematic approaches to software development and spurred the formal recognition of software development as an engineering discipline
Rise of Structured Programming and Methodologies (1970s-1980s):  Structured programming, emphasizing modularity and top-down design, improved code organization and readability
Agile and DevOps Revolution (Late 1990s - Present):Agile methodologies, such as Scrum and Kanban, emphasized iterative development, collaboration, and flexibility.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Planning: Defines scope of the project and sets the foundation of the entire project.
Design: It's about creating a blueprint for how the software will function and meet the requirements defined in the planning phase.
Implementation(Coding): This is where the actual software code is written based on the design specifications.
Testing: Once coding is complete, the software undergoes rigorous testing to identify and fix bugs, errors, and ensure it meets the defined requirements and quality standards. 
Deployment: After successful testing, the software is deployed to the production environment, making it accessible to end-users.
Maintenance:ongoing support, updates, bug fixes, and enhancements to ensure the software continues to operate correctly, adapt to new requirements, and remain relevant over time.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall: Linear and sequential phases. Each phase must complete before the next begins. Changes are difficult and costly to incorporate once a phase is complete.Suited for projects where upfront planning is possible and critical, like large infrastructure projects.
Agile: Development occurs in short cycles (sprints), with frequent releases and feedback loops. Designed to embrace changes throughout the development process. Continuous collaboration with the customer throughout the project.Ideal for innovative products, startups, or projects where market changes are frequent and customer input is essential.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer: Responsible for writing, testing, and maintaining software code.
Quality Assurance (QA) Engineer:  Responsible for ensuring the quality and reliability of the software product. 
Project Manager:Responsible for planning, executing, and closing software projects.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs and VCS are foundational for efficient and effective software development in the tech industry. IDEs boost individual developer productivity and code quality, while VCS enables seamless teamwork, code management, and project stability. Using both tools in conjunction is considered a standard best practice in professional software engineering environments, significantly contributing to the success of software projects.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Work-Life Balance: (Strategy) Boundaries, self-care, time off, support.
Tight Deadlines: (Strategy) Time management, realistic estimates, prioritization.
Evolving Technology: (Strategy) Continuous learning, community engagement.
Ambiguous Requirements: (Strategy) Frequent communication, Agile, prototyping.



Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit Testing: Test individual code parts. (Importance) Early bug detection, robust code foundation.
Integration Testing: Test interaction between units. (Importance) Verify unit collaboration, prevent integration issues.
System Testing: Test entire system. (Importance) Validate system functionality, performance, reliability.
Acceptance Testing (UAT): User testing. (Importance) User satisfaction, business requirement fulfillment, release readiness.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the process of crafting effective prompts to guide AI models for desired outputs.
Some of the importance include:
Overall improvement of AI accuracy and usefulness
Improves AI accuracy and usefulness.
Prompts dictate how AI responds.
Enables complex tasks and creative applications.




Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague prompt: summarize this...
Improved prompt: Summarize the main points of this news article about the recent Nairobi tech conference, focusing on key announcements and attendee reactions, in three sentences or less.

The improved prompt guides the AI to provide a focused and relevant summary. It reduces ambiguity, ensuring the AI understands the desired output and is more likely to deliver a useful and targeted response. The vague prompt offers no direction, likely leading to a generic or unhelpful summary.
